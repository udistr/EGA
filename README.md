# learning package

SLA (sequential learning algorithm)

The SLA gets past predictions from an ensamble of experts/models and past observations and use that to weight the ensamble member based on their performance

Currently this package contains the Exponential Gradient Average (EGA) algorithm. This algorithm is described and used in the folowing papers:
