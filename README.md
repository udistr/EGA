SLA (sequential learning algorithm)

The SLA gets past predictions from an ensamble of experts/models and past observations and use that to weight the ensamble member based on their performance

This algorithm is described and used in the folowing papers:

AR (Asymetric range)

The AR algorithm calibrates the range spaned by an ensable predictions based on past observations. The algorithm uses past predictions and observations and returns calibrated ranges which can be used to construct the probability function.
